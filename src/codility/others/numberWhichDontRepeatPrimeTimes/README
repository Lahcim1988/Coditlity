Task:
Write a function that receives two sequences:
A and B of integers and returns one sequence C.
Sequence C should contain all elements from sequence A
(maintaining the order) except those, that are present
in sequence B p times, where p is a prime number.

Example:
A=[2,3,9,2,5,1,3,7,10]
B=[2,1,3,4,3,10,6,6,1,7,10,10,10]
C=[2,9,2,5,7,10]

Notes:
1. The time complexity is important â€“
    try to write an algorithm with good time
    complexity and specify it in your answer.
2. You can choose any reasonable type present
    in your chosen language to represent the sequence.
3. Make sure the function signature is correct.
4. Write your own code to test primality.
5. We won't run the code, so don't worry about
    making it compilable. For example you can
    skip any header files.
